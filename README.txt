Thanks for using the Official Resource pack for the Varlheim Server!

This pack was created by motaywo and Katastrophic11. 







The Varlheim resource pack was based upon the Clarity Resource Pack created by SCtester. In compliance with their wishes, the original terms of use and pack information has been included also, under the filename <README-2.txt>.
